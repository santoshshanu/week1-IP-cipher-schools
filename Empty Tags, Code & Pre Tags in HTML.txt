	Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
	<br>
	And sorry I could not travel both
	<br>
	And be one traveler, long I stood
	<br>
	And looked down one as far as I could
	<br>
	To where it bent in the undergrowth;
	<br>
	<br>
	Then took the other, as just as fair,
	<br>
	And having perhaps the better claim,
	<br>
	Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
	<br>
	Though as for that the passing there
	<br>
	Had worn them really about the same,
	<br>
	<br>

		In leaves no step had trodden black.

	Oh, I kept the first for another day!
		Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
		I doubted if I should ever come back.
	I shall be telling this with a sigh
		Somewhere ages and ages hence:
		Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
		I took the one less traveled by,
		And that has made all the difference.
